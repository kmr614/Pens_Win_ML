Collect data in CSV
	- Opponent, Goals For, Goals Against, Outcome

Using Artificial Neural Network
	- Take the Opponent and Goals For/Against and make prediction whether the Penguins win the game

- Done    - Maybe create a model to predict how many goals will be scored for both the penguins and the opponent and input then check if the pens win
        - Create one for goals for
            - Take in same data in Pens_ML (Pens_Data.csv) and create model for goals for

- Done - Need to figure out how to take predcition and display it as a actual number


Create a way to get the amount of goals the opponent will score, then merge goals for and goals against into one
